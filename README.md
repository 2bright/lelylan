# Lelylan: Open Source Internet of Things

Lelylan is an iot cloud platform based on a lightweight microservices architecture.

Lelylan platform is both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means you can connect any hardware, from the ESP8622 to the most professional embedded hardware solution and everything in between - and it can run on any public cloud or in your own private datacenter, or even a hybrid environment, whether virtualized or on bare metal.

### Why Lelylan

Research in the Internet of Things is global and growing fast, but lacks standard tools. Many companies are building their own solution. By sharing what we have learned during the last years, we hope to create a shared iot platform for connected products.

### Beta Limitations

We do our best to provide a highly secure, reliable, scalable, and resilient service. However, Lelylan is still in beta and problems may occour. Use the [support channels](http://dev.lelylan.com/support) to solve them.


# Getting started

Lelylan can be installed either on your computer or on servers. To get started, check out the [installation] instructions in the documentation. To better understand how Lelylan Works, learn about the [architecture](http://dev.lelylan.com/architecture) and the [APIs](http://dev.lelylan.com/api) before moving further.

We also offer an interactive tutorial for quickly learning the basics of using Docker.

Usage examples
Docker can be used to run short-lived commands, long-running daemons (app servers, databases, etc.), interactive shell sessions, etc.

You can find a list of real-world examples in the documentation.

Under the hood

Under the hood, Docker is built on the following components:

The cgroups and namespaces capabilities of the Linux kernel
The Go programming language
The Docker Image Specification
The Libcontainer Specification

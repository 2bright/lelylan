#Â Lelylan: Open Source Internet of Things

Lelylan is an iot cloud platform based on a lightwight microservices architecture.

Lelylan platform is both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means you can connect any hardware, from the ESP8622 to the most professional embedded hardware solution and everything in between - and it can run on any public cloud or in your own private datacenter, or even a hybrid environment, whether virtualized or on bare metal.
